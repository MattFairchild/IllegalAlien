This is the alpha version of the game Illegal Alien from Group4. 
This is NOT the final version of the game, but every element of the game is present in at least a basic version. 


The controls are optimized for gamepad usage, and an image depicting the gamepad control scheme can be found in this folder next to this ReadMe file. 
If you don't have a gamepad, you can also play the game using mouse and keyboard controls. A control scheme for mouse and keyboard can be found in this folder as well.
